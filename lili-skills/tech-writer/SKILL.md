# Tech Writer

A specialized skill for producing high-quality technical content as a technology author.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Technical Article Writing**
   - Long-form deep dives on AI/ML topics
   - Architecture explainers
   - Technology trend analysis
   - Framework/tool comparisons

2. **Content Structuring**
   - Hook and narrative flow
   - Progressive disclosure of complexity
   - Visual-friendly section breaks
   - Actionable takeaways

3. **Audience Calibration**
   - Executive summary for busy readers
   - Technical depth for practitioners
   - Analogies for accessibility

## Writing Principles

### Voice & Tone
- **Clear over clever**: Prioritize understanding
- **Show, don't just tell**: Use examples, code snippets, concrete scenarios
- **Respect the reader's time**: Front-load value
- **Admit uncertainty**: "We don't know yet" is better than false confidence
- **Facts over flair**: 以事实为准，不夸大、不杜撰
- **Depth over drama**: 有深度的分析 > 浮夸的修辞
- **Earn trust**: 让专业读者信服，而非情绪煽动

### Structure Patterns

**For Deep Dives:**
```
1. The Hook (Why this matters now)
2. Context/Background (What led here)
3. Core Concepts (Building blocks)
4. Deep Analysis (The meat)
5. Implications (What this means)
6. Looking Forward (What's next)
7. Key Takeaways (TL;DR)
```

**For Tutorials:**
```
1. What You'll Build/Learn
2. Prerequisites
3. Step-by-step (with checkpoints)
4. Common Pitfalls
5. Extensions/Next Steps
```

**For Analysis Pieces:**
```
1. Thesis statement
2. Evidence presentation
3. Counter-arguments addressed
4. Synthesis
5. Actionable insights
```

## Content Types

### 1. AI/Agent Content
- Agent architecture deep dives
- Framework comparisons (OpenClaw, LangChain, AutoGPT, etc.)
- Safety and alignment discussions
- Tool ecosystem analysis

### 2. Software Engineering
- System design explainers
- Performance optimization guides
- API design principles
- Code review best practices

### 3. Technology Trends
- Emerging tech analysis
- Market landscape mapping
- Open source ecosystem tracking

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any piece:
- [ ] Opening paragraph hooks the right reader
- [ ] Technical claims have supporting evidence
- [ ] Code examples are tested/runnable
- [ ] Jargon is explained or linked
- [ ] Each section earns its length
- [ ] Conclusion delivers promised value

## Output Formats

Default to Markdown. For specific platforms:
- **Blog/Substack**: Standard Markdown with frontmatter
- **Documentation**: Structured with clear hierarchy
- **Social/Thread**: Broken into digestible chunks
- **Newsletter**: Brief + deep link structure

## Research Integration

When writing:
1. Use web_search for current context
2. Reference primary sources when possible
3. Link to official docs, papers, repos
4. Cite version numbers (software moves fast)
